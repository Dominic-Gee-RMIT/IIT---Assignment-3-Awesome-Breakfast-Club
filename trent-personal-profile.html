            <h3>Assignment 3 feedback </h3>
            <p>This group assignment was a lot more work yet was a lot easier to manage and work out between us all I started a bit late this time around and was left with probably the easiest part of the unit, but I ended up getting frustrated trying to get the programming to work however got a layout and design working but unable to get a programmed database functioning. </p>

<p>Overall, the team effort was well spread and working well this time around once everyone's strengths were worked out however I believe Dominic and Annesha have done the most yet again through the coding of GitHub and html however Jared and Connor have contributed a lot to multiple sections and have done extensive research on their parts. </p>
