<p>“My name is Annesha Sharp, student number S3691179 and I am a member of the team ‘Awesome Breakfast Club’. I am a 23-year-old Software Tester, with one and a half years of experience in the IT industry.

I discovered my Interest in IT after partially completing an arts degree and feeling unsure of my future career, in my study sabbatical I began working as a database officer and have enjoyed working in IT ever since. I found from experience that I flourish working in IT, and that I really enjoy assisting others to understand Technology.”</p>
<h5>Ideal job and career plan - Technical business analyst</h5>
<p>Technical Business Analyst’s overall role involves aligning technology systems with business operations by analysing and developing innovative integrated software solutions. Their duties include providing internal IT support and managing web-based software solutions as well as regularly reporting to management (Technical Business Analyst Job Description, 2022). Currently working as a Software Tester, I am building my experience within the IT industry in a role which works closely with Technical Business Analyst. The role of Software Tester requires strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which I have demonstrated daily. Working in a SCRUM methodology, I also utilise my interpersonal skills to maintain communication with stakeholders and team members, and often work as a back-up SRUM master within the team. In the early years of my career, I have already gained experience in facilitating ICT workshops for User Acceptance Testing, End User Training, and SCRUM Retrospectives. Currently I have many of the foundational skills required for this role and will continue to grow these throughout my study and work opportunities. In my studies I plan to grow my technical knowledge with a particular focus on cloud computing. After graduating from RMIT with a Bachelor of Information Technology, I plan to complete my CBAP through the International Institute of Business Analysts. Through my current work, I also plan to undertake professional development secondments which can assist to grow my experience as a business analyst. </p>

<p>“Hi there, my name is Connor James Simpson, my RMIT student number is; s3965238 and I am a member of the team: Awesome Breakfast Club. I come from a middling family, both mum and dad have worked in a variety of jobs, and I went to a public school. Made friends and lost friends and eventually found who my real mates were through trial and error! Education wise I have completed year 12 and done a Certificate II in Information and Technology. On top of that, if you can believe it, I am a college drop-out! My home language is English, though my folks, my sister and I all speak a little bit of everything, some days we will greet each other in a mix of English, German and French or ask for something in any number of other languages that we have investigated and studied enough to have some basic understanding of, what can I say, we all enjoy languages though we were all born in Australia. When it comes to down time, I enjoy gaming, whether its video games or tabletop RPG’s so long as I get to chat with some mates and celebrate good wins, I am a happy Chappy!”</p>
<h5>Ideal job and career plan - Cybersecurity analyst</h5>
<p>Cyber Security Analysts works to protect the hardware, software and networks of the company, organisation or individual they work for from cybercriminals and attacks. They need to understand the IT infrastructure in detail, have a means of monitoring the system at all times whilst evaluating threats that could breach the network and threaten the security of the company. Overall, they’re job is to attempt to enhance the network security and protect sensitive information by those they’re employed by (How to become a Cybersecurity Analyst, 2022).  The skills the company is asking for are pretty standard for someone who would have some degree of Cyber Security experience. It’s clear they want someone who has a degree under their belt and with knowledge pertaining to the standard activities of what a Cyber Security specialist would know, from system architecture and infrastructure security to knowledge surrounding technological trends and developments. Communication, as with any job really, is a must, and they want someone who knows information security and risk control. At best my skills and experience are rudimentary at best, I know my way around most programs and am a quick study when it comes to problem solving, though I generally have to be shown the problem in the first place. I’m highly adaptive when the situation calls for it and can be good under stress, usually keeping cool, calm and collected, though some may call it detached. My time spent working for Beer Wine and Spirits, a retail company, has allowed me to grow my communication and engagement sells greatly during the time I worked there. I don’t really plan so much as undertake a series of events and force the flow of those events to allow me to get what I want, in this instance the study I am doing would be more than sufficient. The goal is to undertake each section of study and work my way towards completing each part with, at the very least, minimum passing requirements. Naturally I would like to do the best possible but it’s not always doable. The courses I am undertaking at present will take me the rest of this year and into next year to complete. I’m unsure how long it will take to complete the follow-on tasks, but at a rough estimate I would say between 2-4 years if I’m being optimistic. I guess the plan is to study hard, having said all that. </p>

</ui>
<p>“Hi! I usually go by ‘Dom’, student number S3961464 and I am a member of the team ‘Awesome Breakfast Club’. I’m naturally hard-working and outgoing with a positive outlook. I can quickly build meaningful relationships and I gravitate towards people who are self-motivated. Should issues unfortunately arise, I believe in fully understanding the view of all involved by discussing them openly and honestly. I also believe that there is always a reasonable solution that can suit all parties in such instances. I enjoy walking in the woodland with my wife and dogs, watching a variety of sports and movies, particularly fantasy or sci-fi, reading fantasy books and trying to keep up with current affairs. I am currently studying toward a Bachelor of Commerce in my spare time, being one year into the six-year, part time degree, I have a long way to go but am enjoying the learning experience. My wife and I are also excitedly expecting our first child on the break of the coming new year, so we are spending lots of time planning for them!”</p>
<h5>Ideal job and career plan - Financial Accountant</h5>
<p>Financial Accountants are responsible for, obviously, running the accounting and financial activities of an organisation. They analyse the economic stability of the company and provide financial information to other departments to make budgeting and investment decisions. They report on costs, productivity, margins and company expenditures alongside tax and inventory, balance sheets, funding advisory and internal audits, among a plethora of other things (Financial Accounting Job Description Guide, 2022).  Since I have no qualifications or experience with accounting, my first goal is to complete a bachelor’s degree in commerce, majoring in accounting and taxation. This is a basic requirement to be accredited by ASIC, the governing body for accounting practices in Australia. Once I have completed my degree, I will look to obtain an internship, so that I can learn key areas of the industry with guidance from experienced professionals, gain experience with budgeting and cyclical reporting get to know useful day to day tools and build toward the 3 years’ experience required by roles such as this, which I would like to work in one day.  In the meantime, if the internship does not provide experience with Lettus Distribution system or BI/BO, then I will watch YouTube videos or access industry forums to enhance my knowledge of such products. I could also enhance my knowledge of agriculture or horticulture by taking a vocational break, volunteering with fruit picking seasons in the regional areas of my home state.</p>

<p>“My name is Jared, my student number is s3960173 and I am a part of the team: Awesome breakfast club. am an aspiring IT (Information Technology) student of RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). I am starting my journey again into the world of education after the 2 years of break from the schooling system to set myself up for the future ahead (as well as the hindrance of covid). I moved away from my hometown after graduating year 12 to re-evaluate myself and what I wanted to do for the future. Using the extra free time, I had I began to pick up hobbies and interests I was not able to do from my old home. I went out to buy my first skateboard being unsure if I was going to be interested and invested enough to learn. The first few days were like learning to walk again with my balance completely off for every new movement I tried. Although I still feel like a novice to the sport and have much to learn, it has become the most peaceful, calming, and fun activities that I am dedicated to mastering. Skateboarding allowed me to strengthen my physical abilities, clear my mind when needed, as well as understanding how to express myself internally and externally. Using my love for skateboard art and the board itself to express myself within the sport by using the skills I had learned and the art I use to convey my love for the sport and emotions.”</p>
<h5>Ideal job and career plan - Cyber Analyst</h5>
<p>Cyber Analysts are an army career that goes through the Cyber Specialist pathway they share a similar role to the Cyber Security Analyst however they’re capacity as a military unit changes a great deal of things. They are dedicated to defending military systems and networks, ensuring they remain secure and stable alongside finding rapid-fire solutions to defend against cyber threats. Furthermore, where a Cyber Security Analyst is part of the corporate field, the Cyber Analyst’s military role means they are working with other agencies, governments and international organisations, here they also operate at a tactical and strategic level conducting cyber activities to defend and assure the integrity of their systems (Cyber Analyst, 2022).  The role can be entered without any experience or qualifications other than being 17 or over. The role can be entered unqualified or fully qualified. Preference will be given towards people who display skill, interest and experience relevant to ICT (Information and Communications Technology). The job is still a competitive application process which will require adequate competencies for the role. The period for trainees will have a lower income within their salary from $51,277 P.A. (per Annum) Full trained employees will have a base salary of $77,138. The minimal education allowed is completed year 10 of high schooling English, mathematics, or an equivalent education. Currently I have no qualifications other than completed schooling that will allow me to go into the role fully qualified. I hope to have the basics of the training already completed before entering the role. This should improve my chances of getting the role over others. I plan at minimum to gain my basics degrees in IT and ICT and choose a direction to focus on in Cyber security. Otherwise, I may decide to study and improve on my skill before applying for the role. </p>

<h3>Group Processes</h3>
<p>In assignment 2 our group had good, regular communication, however at times we were hindered by our unfamiliarity with the new platforms we were learning such as Microsoft Teams and Github. This was overcome through practice and sharing of our experiences and understanding of the platforms. Another difficulty we faced in assignment 2 was conflicting busy schedules and time zone differences. We overcame this by keeping clear and regular communications regarding our availability and we tried to schedule meetings as often as possible to ensure that everyone was getting plenty of opportunity to be present. In assignment 2 we also found that communications were missed because of personal preferences for different communications platforms such as team's vs discord. In assignment 3, we have each made active efforts to ensure we are posting messages on all platforms and responding to all platforms to ensure that everyone is up to date with each other and that nothing is missed.  
We have made 2 major changes to our structure for assignment 3. Firstly, we have very early on communicated our expectations around the share of assignment work. This feedback has been well received across the group and significant efforts have been made by all members to ensure that no one is left to feel overwhelmed with assignment 3.  
The other considerable change we have made, is that we have split into two groups so that we can maintain focus and handle the concurrent requirements of both assignments 3 & 5. This has been successful so far and has allowed us to make good progress whilst not falling behind on other aspects of the unit.</p>
<h3>Ideal Jobs comparison</h3>
<p>The largest common element with all the jobs listed that we’ve chosen as our “Ideal Jobs” is that they all involve Computers and Information Technology in one aspect or another. Security Engineers, Cyber Security Analysts and Cyber Analysts play very similar roles to one another; keeping the systems they’re in charge of secure from outside threats and ensuring those systems are up to scratch. All three analyst jobs involve going over data and dictating non-urgent tasks over to the appropriate teams to be taken care of in multiple areas. </p>
<h3>Career Plans comparison</h3>
<p>Annesha's’ plan for achieving her dream career is study on and improve on her skills and certain areas of her desired position and working alongside people in the technical business analyst area. This aligns similarly with Dominics goals which are to improve upon his skills and hone them while applying for an internship so that he can gain the experience needed for the role. Dominic also relays a backup plan to continue his study and find alternative ways on gaining the experience he needs necessary his ideal career. Contrasting with Jared and Connors approaches, their goals so far are to achieve their dream careers by completing the minimum requirements. Although Connor intends to study and improve upon his skills beyond a basic sufficient level. Jared slightly contrasting can enter his career without any necessary study though intends to study outside and improve his chances of qualifying for the still competitive position to increase his chances for success and brace himself for the position. Trent does not have a clear career plan but his clear goals to study and gain skills he sees as necessary for his job. Trent, Jared, and Connor share their interest in cyber security with slightly varied roles which offer them similarities and slight difference in their career path goals. Through our different approaches there are some comparable decisions made which start with everyone's goals to study and improve upon their skills. Each member sees that even though the bare minimum is an option they would prefer to continue to improve so that they will be competent and successful for the job.</p>
