<p>“Hi there, my name is Connor James Simpson, my RMIT student number is; s3965238 and I am a member of the team: Awesome Breakfast Club. I come from a middling family, both mum and dad have worked in a variety of jobs, and I went to a public school. Made friends and lost friends and eventually found who my real mates were through trial and error! Education wise I have completed year 12 and done a Certificate II in Information and Technology. On top of that, if you can believe it, I am a college drop-out! My home language is English, though my folks, my sister and I all speak a little bit of everything, some days we will greet each other in a mix of English, German and French or ask for something in any number of other languages that we have investigated and studied enough to have some basic understanding of, what can I say, we all enjoy languages though we were all born in Australia. When it comes to down time, I enjoy gaming, whether its video games or tabletop RPG’s so long as I get to chat with some mates and celebrate good wins, I am a happy Chappy!”</p>

<p>“Hi! I usually go by ‘Dom’, student number S3961464 and I am a member of the team ‘Awesome Breakfast Club’. I’m naturally hard-working and outgoing with a positive outlook. I can quickly build meaningful relationships and I gravitate towards people who are self-motivated. Should issues unfortunately arise, I believe in fully understanding the view of all involved by discussing them openly and honestly. I also believe that there is always a reasonable solution that can suit all parties in such instances. I enjoy walking in the woodland with my wife and dogs, watching a variety of sports and movies, particularly fantasy or sci-fi, reading fantasy books and trying to keep up with current affairs. I am currently studying toward a Bachelor of Commerce in my spare time, being one year into the six-year, part time degree, I have a long way to go but am enjoying the learning experience. My wife and I are also excitedly expecting our first child on the break of the coming new year, so we are spending lots of time planning for them!”</p>

<p>“My name is Jared, my student number is s3960173 and I am a part of the team: Awesome breakfast club. am an aspiring IT (Information Technology) student of RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). I am starting my journey again into the world of education after the 2 years of break from the schooling system to set myself up for the future ahead (as well as the hindrance of covid). I moved away from my hometown after graduating year 12 to re-evaluate myself and what I wanted to do for the future. Using the extra free time, I had I began to pick up hobbies and interests I was not able to do from my old home. I went out to buy my first skateboard being unsure if I was going to be interested and invested enough to learn. The first few days were like learning to walk again with my balance completely off for every new movement I tried. Although I still feel like a novice to the sport and have much to learn, it has become the most peaceful, calming, and fun activities that I am dedicated to mastering. Skateboarding allowed me to strengthen my physical abilities, clear my mind when needed, as well as understanding how to express myself internally and externally. Using my love for skateboard art and the board itself to express myself within the sport by using the skills I had learned and the art I use to convey my love for the sport and emotions.”</p>

<h3>Group Processes</h3>
<p>In assignment 2 our group had good, regular communication, however at times we were hindered by our unfamiliarity with the new platforms we were learning such as Microsoft Teams and Github. This was overcome through practice and sharing of our experiences and understanding of the platforms. Another difficulty we faced in assignment 2 was conflicting busy schedules and time zone differences. We overcame this by keeping clear and regular communications regarding our availability and we tried to schedule meetings as often as possible to ensure that everyone was getting plenty of opportunity to be present. In assignment 2 we also found that communications were missed because of personal preferences for different communications platforms such as team's vs discord. In assignment 3, we have each made active efforts to ensure we are posting messages on all platforms and responding to all platforms to ensure that everyone is up to date with each other and that nothing is missed.  
We have made 2 major changes to our structure for assignment 3. Firstly, we have very early on communicated our expectations around the share of assignment work. This feedback has been well received across the group and significant efforts have been made by all members to ensure that no one is left to feel overwhelmed with assignment 3.  
The other considerable change we have made, is that we have split into two groups so that we can maintain focus and handle the concurrent requirements of both assignments 3 & 5. This has been successful so far and has allowed us to make good progress whilst not falling behind on other aspects of the unit.</p>
