<h5>Ideal job and career plan - Technical business analyst</h5>
<p>Technical Business Analyst’s overall role involves aligning technology systems with business operations by analysing and developing innovative integrated software solutions. Their duties include providing internal IT support and managing web-based software solutions as well as regularly reporting to management (Technical Business Analyst Job Description, 2022). Currently working as a Software Tester, I am building my experience within the IT industry in a role which works closely with Technical Business Analyst. The role of Software Tester requires strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which I have demonstrated daily. Working in a SCRUM methodology, I also utilise my interpersonal skills to maintain communication with stakeholders and team members, and often work as a back-up SRUM master within the team. In the early years of my career, I have already gained experience in facilitating ICT workshops for User Acceptance Testing, End User Training, and SCRUM Retrospectives. Currently I have many of the foundational skills required for this role and will continue to grow these throughout my study and work opportunities. In my studies I plan to grow my technical knowledge with a particular focus on cloud computing. After graduating from RMIT with a Bachelor of Information Technology, I plan to complete my CBAP through the International Institute of Business Analysts. Through my current work, I also plan to undertake professional development secondments which can assist to grow my experience as a business analyst. </p>

        <h3> Assignment 3 feedback</h3>
        <p> Upon reflecting on our performance as a group in assignment 3, I think we made lots of improvements and became a cohesive and proactive group. Our communication improved straight away, as we started the assignment by having open discussions about feedback and expectations. We also opened lines of communication over teams and discord to cater for all group member’s preferences and notified the team when we were online and available for a group study session, this really increased collaboration and further supported the group members that prefer working with others. </p>
<p>One factor we could have improved upon would be setting a procedure of what to do when you need assistance, as some of the team members found asking for help a topic that was difficult to approach. </p>
<p>I was surprised by the positive impacts of openly discussing our feedback and expectations. I expected it to likely result in conflict and tension, however everyone approached the matter with an open-mind and made an effort to improve, which brought our team closer together. </p>
<p>In this process I learnt the value of sharing our skills within the group, so we can all learn from each other and gain experience. Whilst it may take extra time, we found it resulted in more uptake and usage of the Teams channel and the GitHub repository. </p>
