<p>“Hi there, my name is Connor James Simpson, my RMIT student number is; s3965238 and I am a member of the team: Awesome Breakfast Club. I come from a middling family, both mum and dad have worked in a variety of jobs, and I went to a public school. Made friends and lost friends and eventually found who my real mates were through trial and error! Education wise I have completed year 12 and done a Certificate II in Information and Technology. On top of that, if you can believe it, I am a college drop-out! My home language is English, though my folks, my sister and I all speak a little bit of everything, some days we will greet each other in a mix of English, German and French or ask for something in any number of other languages that we have investigated and studied enough to have some basic understanding of, what can I say, we all enjoy languages though we were all born in Australia. When it comes to down time, I enjoy gaming, whether its video games or tabletop RPG’s so long as I get to chat with some mates and celebrate good wins, I am a happy Chappy!”</p>
<h5>Ideal job and career plan - Cybersecurity analyst</h5>
<p>Cyber Security Analysts works to protect the hardware, software and networks of the company, organisation or individual they work for from cybercriminals and attacks. They need to understand the IT infrastructure in detail, have a means of monitoring the system at all times whilst evaluating threats that could breach the network and threaten the security of the company. Overall, they’re job is to attempt to enhance the network security and protect sensitive information by those they’re employed by (How to become a Cybersecurity Analyst, 2022).  The skills the company is asking for are pretty standard for someone who would have some degree of Cyber Security experience. It’s clear they want someone who has a degree under their belt and with knowledge pertaining to the standard activities of what a Cyber Security specialist would know, from system architecture and infrastructure security to knowledge surrounding technological trends and developments. Communication, as with any job really, is a must, and they want someone who knows information security and risk control. At best my skills and experience are rudimentary at best, I know my way around most programs and am a quick study when it comes to problem solving, though I generally have to be shown the problem in the first place. I’m highly adaptive when the situation calls for it and can be good under stress, usually keeping cool, calm and collected, though some may call it detached. My time spent working for Beer Wine and Spirits, a retail company, has allowed me to grow my communication and engagement sells greatly during the time I worked there. I don’t really plan so much as undertake a series of events and force the flow of those events to allow me to get what I want, in this instance the study I am doing would be more than sufficient. The goal is to undertake each section of study and work my way towards completing each part with, at the very least, minimum passing requirements. Naturally I would like to do the best possible but it’s not always doable. The courses I am undertaking at present will take me the rest of this year and into next year to complete. I’m unsure how long it will take to complete the follow-on tasks, but at a rough estimate I would say between 2-4 years if I’m being optimistic. I guess the plan is to study hard, having said all that. </p>

        <h3> Assignment 3 feedback</h3>
        <p>Looking back at our first group assignment and taking stock of what the group has achieved in the third assessment item its immediately noticeable how, as a group, we’ve changed and altered what we do and how we go about it in order to get the best results from individuals! As an example; I made Annesha aware that it would be a good idea for me to have a list of things to do so that I could just hack into them and get them done. </p>

<p>This was good in practice, though neither of us actually ended up making an official list, agreeing to do things verbally and reminding ourselves and each other where we needed to. I applied the same energy to the main assessment item, which was impressively done already, talking with group members and finding my little niche as I went along. I also think the improved communication helped the project as a whole with a better standard and quality of work from everyone and all parties being much more involved with their individual and group roles. </p>

<p>Continuing to be open and talk about group goals as a group can only improve how we do with the assessment items in future and can even make things more easy than they are for us at present! So long as everyone is able to be open and talk about their strengths and weaknesses we can work together and settle up our differences, lending a shoulder for each other to lean on as its needed and giving the right nudge when we can. </p>

<p>We definitely need a deadline setter, as much as I’d love to say we work extremely well together and don’t need to have things done by a set time, I’ve found that I struggle with keep a track of time and importance of when things need to be done. As a result this is directly detrimental to the group as a whole and I’d rather not be part of the problem, it is said that in order to be part of the solution you first have to accept that there's a problem and how your affected. </p>
